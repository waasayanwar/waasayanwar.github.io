<h2><strong>Class Attendance:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Attendance is mandatory for lab classes. Attendance will be taken at the
beginning of the class. If you enter the class 10 minutes late, you will get a late attendance. If you
come to the class 30 minutes late you will be considered as absent. Two late attendances equal to
one absent.
</p>
<h2><strong>Exams and Quizzes:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Exams and quizzes will be closed book and closed notes. No electronic
devices except non-programmable calculators will be allowed during exams. Calculators cannot
be shared with friends. Nobody will be allowed to go outside the exam hall. There will be no
makeup quizzes.
</p>
<h2><strong>Lab Report:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
You have to submit Lab reports at the beginning of the class when it is due. If you
miss this deadline, your points will be reduced by 40% for next day submission. If you miss the
next day’s deadline, your will get zero credit for that Lab report. All the Lab reports should be
done and submitted individually. You may take guidance from your friend but are not allowed to
copy lab reports especially the discussion part.
</p>
<h2><strong>Class Etiquette:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Distracting others in lab class is violating others rights to be attentive. So, laptop
or cell phones cannot be turned on during class time. Group discussion is encouraged and personal
discussion is discouraged during class time.
</p>
<h2><strong>General Course Administration:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I’ll provide the lab manual and you’ll have to complete the
given tasks during the class time. Last 30 minutes of the class is fixed for checking and grading.
I’ll explain the problems at the beginning of the class and you can ask me at any point of the class,
if you need any additional information.
</p>
<h2><strong>Academic Honesty:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Any means of unauthorized assistance in preparing materials which a student
submits as original work is deemed to be cheating. Any kind of cheating or plagiarism will make
your obtained marks zero for that report, assignment, quiz or exam. Both who copied and who let
others copy will be treated as same, meaning both will get zero for that report, assignment, quiz or
exam
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><i>** If you fail to get 60% marks (12 out of 20) in the lab,
you will also get a F in the course **</i></h2>
